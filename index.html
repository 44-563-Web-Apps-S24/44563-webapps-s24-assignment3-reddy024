    <h4>
        Favourite Restaurent

    <p>
        As a child, I was not fond of eating out. My family would eat at a restaurant, diner, or buffet at least once a week, often more than once. Every time we went anywhere, but for a little place called Rivenee’s, it was a challenge for my parents to find <b>proper food and a nice atmosphere.</b> Rivenee’s was that lucky exception—I loved the place and this made my parents love it too. <b>The restaurant seemed magical and fascinating </b>Tto me when I was an elementary school kid, and surprisingly, the place still fascinates me today. Recently, when I visited my old family house for Thanksgiving, I was astonished and pleased to find out the place still operated and, in fact, was still run by the same family. Apart from the house in which I grew up, Rivenee’s is probably the dearest place to me in the small town, just outside of San Ramon, where I was born and raised
